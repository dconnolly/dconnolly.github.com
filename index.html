            <ul>
                <li>
                    Lead engineer
                    on <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra">Zebra</a>,
                    a Rust implementation
                    of <a href="https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf">Zcash</a>,
                    a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency. Drove from a
                    proof-of-concept async, modular, network protocol
                    implementation based on the Tokio runtime and Tower service
                    abstractions to a full validation node that syncs and
                    validates multiple kinds of zkSNARKs, elliptic curve
                    signatures, blinded commitment merkle trees, and more in
                    half the time of the standard reference implementation of
                    Zcash, all in Rust modulo a few dependencies. Grew and
                    mentored team from two to six contributors over two years.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Implemented <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/main/zebra-chain">Zcash's
                    Orchard, Sapling, and Sprout key, note, commitment, and
                    note commitment tree derivation / computation in Rust</a>,
                    including property testing and test vector compatibility
                    coverage.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Implemented and upstreamed batch verification
                  for <a href="https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman/pull/59">Groth16
                  zkSNARK proofs</a>
                  and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/redjubjub/pull/36">RedJubjub
                  Schnorr-style signatures</a> that support
                  re-randomization. This batch math was integrated
                  with <a href="https://www.zfnd.org/blog/futures-batch-verification/">async
                  futures-based verification</a>
                  in <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/main/zebra-consensus/src">Zebra</a>.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Implemented
                    the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">FROST
                    threshold signature protocol</a> for RedJubjub with Chelsea
                    Komlo, which was

                    in March 2021</a>. This has been integrated into at least
                    one Zcash wallet so far.

                    dependency locking & updating with Dependabot, code coverage
                    collection and tracking, restricting merging to #main only
                    from U2F/WebAuthn'd team members on green CI, automatic
                    deployment of multiple zebrad nodes on green #main CI,
                    monitored and kept up by automated deployment systems, with
                    panics logged & correlated with change version, reported to
